# Occluded Object Detection with Scarce Data

This code was part of CSE 40536/60536 (Spring 2021) University of Notre Dame. 

To deal with the scarse data problem we performed synthetic image generation, that process was based on [1].

We perform finetuning of the pretrained model **mask rcnn R 50 FPN 3x.** available on the Detectron2 Model Zoo.
